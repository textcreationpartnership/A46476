            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The hurrying of Us under a Guard from Our City of <hi>London, h</hi> whoſe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Loyalty We could no longer Truſt, and the other Indignities We ſuffered in the Perſon of the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> when ſent to him by Us; and in that barbarous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of Our own Perſon, We ſhall not here repeat, becauſe they are, We doubt not by this time, very well known; and may, We hope, if enough conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon; together with his other Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Breaches of the Laws and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> which by this Invaſion he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reſtore, be ſufficient to open the Eyes of all Our Subjects, and let them plainly ſee what every one of them may expect, and what Treatment they ſhall find from him, if at any time it may ſerve his purpoſe, from whoſe hands a Soveraign Prince, an Uncle, and a Father could meet with no better Entertainment. <hi>i</hi> However the ſenſe of theſe Indignities, and the juſt apprehenſion of further Attempts againſt Our Perſon by them who already endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to murther Our Reputation by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Calumnies (as if We had been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a ſuppoſed Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>) which was incomparably more Injurious, then the Deſtroying of Our Perſon it Self; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſerious reflection on a Saying of Our Royal Father of Bleſſed Memory, when He was in the like Circumſtances, <hi>That there is little diſtance between the Priſons and the Graves of Princes</hi> (which afterwards proved too true in His Caſe) could not but perſuade Us to make uſe of that which the Law of Nature gives to the meaneſt of Our Subjects, of freeing Our ſelves by all means poſſible from that unjuſt Confinement and Reſtraint. <hi>k</hi> And this We did not more for the Security of Our own Perſon, than that thereby We might be in a better Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of tranſacting and providing for every thing that may Contribute to the Peace and Settlement of Our Kingdoms: For as on the one hand, no change of Fortune ſhall ever make Us forget Our ſelves, ſo far as to Condeſcend to any thing, unbecoming that High and Royal Station, in which God Almighty by Right of Succeſſion has placed Us: <hi>l</hi> So on the other hand, neither the Provocation or Ingratitude of Our own Subjects, nor any other Conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſhall ever prevail with Us to make

the leaſt ſtep contrary to the True Intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; which We ever did, and ever muſt look upon as Our own.

and Priviledges in the four years of his Reign, than his Predeceſſors for fourſcore years has made for our preſervation: <hi>c</hi> Indeed as he is willing to ſuggeſt he made an offer of reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redreſs, but we way preſume to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he miſtruſted his Game when ſaw the Trump turn'd up, and ſo like a wary Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was willing to change his Cards, or elſe refer himſelf to the good hap of another Deal: <hi>d</hi> His Majeſty is pleaſed to tell us he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have all grievances redreſs'd by a free Parliament, which he reſolved ſpeedily to call, but as this could not ſuit with the ſafety and wiſhes of ſome corrupt Miniſters about him, ſo he was readily perſwaded to quit thoſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and though ſome of the Writs were iſſued out for their Sitting, yet he ſhewed us the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his meaning by his ſudden withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>e</hi> That the Prince meant nothing elſe by his coming, than the re-ſettling the ſhaken Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Laws and Religion, by an open and free Convention of the States, is plain, from his great moderation ſince their Sitting, and we may juſtly ſay, he has been far more modest in all his demands, than we have been grateful in the readineſs of our Grants. <hi>f</hi> I know not how we can believe his Majeſty was ever under restraint ſince his ſo eaſie Deſertion ſeems to contradict the Aſſertion: <hi>g</hi> That the City or Country had changed their reſolution, we cannot apprehend, and their conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereing to their firſt Addreſſes to the Prince, ſhews his Majeſty has been deceived in his News: <hi>h</hi> How inſtrumental the Prince has been in defaming his Majeſty, eſpecially in the matter of the P. of <hi>Wales,</hi> all the Kingdom can judge, and we all could wiſh his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reputation may be proved innocent and clear from ſo black a Deſign: However we wiſh that his Majeſty had been pleaſed to have left the Infant among us, which after the proof of his Birth of the Queen had been a great Security of his Title to the Crown. <hi>i</hi> As his Majeſty has received many ſignal proofs of our love and duty, ſo in this Retirement of his, he has been pleaſed to ſhew us the firſt inſtance of his care of our Safty, <hi>k</hi> and as his Majeſty <hi>never</hi> gave us reaſon to ſuſpect the intention of his promiſes, never to moleſt or injure the peace and interest of his Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> ſo we cannot but in gratitude wiſh his Majeſty all the Peace and Quiet that his pious Zeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to. <hi>l</hi> His Majeſty in his gracious Condeſcenſions is pleaſed again to promiſe us the preſervation of our Laws and Liberties, and eſpecially the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> but becauſe we cannot invent other means to aſſure us of the performance of this than his Word, the repeated breach of which he has not as yet vouchſafed to acknowledge, we can hardly be ſure of his Majeſties meaning, and may inſtead of finding redreſs of our grievances, be apprehended as Slanderers, and puniſhed as Criminals.</p>
